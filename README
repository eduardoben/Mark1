# MARK 1 - Skin Cancer Classification Project

## Overview
This project is a skin cancer classifier that uses a trained ResNet18 model to classify images of size 224x224. The classification results are shared with a locally deployed Large Language Model (LLM) using LocalAI. The system is designed for local use.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Upload an image via the GUI to classify it as skin cancer or not.
- **LLM Integration**: The classification result is shared with a locally deployed LLM for further interaction.
- **Local Deployment**: Both the classifier and LLM are deployed locally for privacy and efficiency.

## How to Use
1. Run `GUI.py` to start the graphical user interface.
2. Upload an image for classification.
3. View the classification result and interact with the LLM for additional insights.

## Technical Details
- **Model**: ResNet18 trained for skin cancer classification.
- **Image Requirements**: Images must be 224x224 pixels.
- **LLM**: LocalAI is used to deploy the LLM locally.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `GUI.py` to start the application.

## File Structure
- `GUI.py`: Main file for user interaction.
