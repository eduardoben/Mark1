# MARK 1 - Skin Cancer Classification Project

## 🏥 Overview

A **skin cancer classifier** using a trained **ResNet18** model on **224x224 images**, integrated with a **locally deployed LLM (LocalAI)** for offline, privacy-focused analysis and interaction.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Image Classification:** Upload an image via the GUI to classify for skin cancer.
* **LLM Integration:** Share results with a local LLM for interactive explanations.
* **Local Deployment:** Runs entirely offline for privacy and speed.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run the GUI:

   ```bash
   python GUI.py
   ```
2. Upload an image for classification.
3. View the classification result and interact with the LLM for additional insights.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

* **Model:** ResNet18 fine-tuned for skin cancer classification.
* **Input Requirements:** Images of size `224x224`.
* **LLM:** LocalAI deployed locally for offline LLM capabilities.
